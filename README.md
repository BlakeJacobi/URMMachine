This project implements a Universal Register Machine (URM) in Java using ANTLR for parsing instructions. 
The URM machine simulates a simple theoretical computer that operates on registers, executing instructions
like setting a register to zero, incrementing it, jumping to a different instruction based on conditions, 
or transferring values between registers. The machine reads an input program, executes each instruction 
step-by-step, and prints the current state of the registers after each step.
